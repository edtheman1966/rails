{"name":"Rails/ezzzymoney/fishbait","tagline":"Ruby on Rails","body":"## Welcome to Rails\r\n\r\nRails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to\r\ncreate database-backed web applications according to the\r\n[Model-View-Controller (MVC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller)\r\npattern.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides your\r\napplication into three layers, each with a specific responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe _Model layer_ represents your domain model (such as Account, Product,\r\nPerson, Post, etc.) and encapsulates the business logic that is specific to\r\nyour application. In Rails, database-backed model classes are derived from\r\n`ActiveRecord::Base`. Active Record allows you to present the data from\r\ndatabase rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic\r\nmethods. You can read more about Active Record in its [README](activerecord/README.rdoc).\r\nAlthough most Rails models are backed by a database, models can also be ordinary\r\nRuby classes, or Ruby classes that implement a set of interfaces as provided by\r\nthe Active Model module. You can read more about Active Model in its [README](activemodel/README.rdoc).\r\n\r\nThe _Controller layer_ is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and\r\nproviding a suitable response. Usually this means returning HTML, but Rails controllers\r\ncan also generate XML, JSON, PDFs, mobile-specific views, and more. Controllers load and\r\nmanipulate models, and render view templates in order to generate the appropriate HTTP response.\r\nIn Rails, incoming requests are routed by Action Dispatch to an appropriate controller, and\r\ncontroller classes are derived from `ActionController::Base`. Action Dispatch and Action Controller\r\nare bundled together in Action Pack. You can read more about Action Pack in its\r\n[README](actionpack/README.rdoc).\r\n\r\nThe _View layer_ is composed of \"templates\" that are responsible for providing\r\nappropriate representations of your application's resources. Templates can\r\ncome in a variety of formats, but most view templates are HTML with embedded\r\nRuby code (ERB files). Views are typically rendered to generate a controller response,\r\nor to generate the body of an email. In Rails, View generation is handled by Action View.\r\nYou can read more about Action View in its [README](actionview/README.rdoc).\r\n\r\nActive Record, Action Pack, and Action View can each be used independently outside Rails.\r\nIn addition to them, Rails also comes with Action Mailer ([README](actionmailer/README.rdoc)), a library\r\nto generate and send emails; Active Job ([README](activejob/README.md)), a\r\nframework for declaring jobs and making them run on a variety of queueing\r\nbackends; and Active Support ([README](activesupport/README.rdoc)), a collection\r\nof utility classes and standard library extensions that are useful for Rails,\r\nand may also be used independently outside Rails.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n1. Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:\r\n\r\n        gem install rails\r\n\r\n2. At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:\r\n\r\n        rails new myapp\r\n\r\n   where \"myapp\" is the application name.\r\n\r\n3. Change directory to `myapp` and start the web server:\r\n\r\n        cd myapp\r\n        rails server\r\n\r\n   Run with `--help` or `-h` for options.\r\n\r\n4. Using a browser, go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see:\r\n\"Welcome aboard: You're riding Ruby on Rails!\"\r\n\r\n5. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application.
